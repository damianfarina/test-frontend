Blueprint and JQuery, which made me believe in
web UI development again.</p><p>Worked for more than a year in a big CMS. The application

framework for PHP, to meet the requirements of the app. The first 
version of the app UI was built with Backbase, later on we moved to 
Adobe Flex. One of the main features of the app was the synchronization 
between the mobile and desktop apps and the server. PostgreSQL and
its powerful PL/pgSQL language helped a lot when dealing with performance 
issues. PostGIS was in charge of solving the spatial problems.</p><p>The most exciting experience at GISWorking, was work with a great team 
and to have the honor of leading the project.
